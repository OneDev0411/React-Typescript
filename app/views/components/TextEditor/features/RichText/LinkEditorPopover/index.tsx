/**
 * Challenges in positioning:
 * - We want to position the overlay based on some selection which is not
 * necessarily a DOM node and we can't simply get it's bounding client rect.
 *  We can use selection client rect but as soon as focus is grabbed inside
 *  an input inside the overlay, we lost the selection and it breaks the
 *  positioning.
 * - We need to make sure positioning works no matter the there is an scrollable
 *   container or it's the window that scrolls.
 * - We can make the overlay portal or not.
 *   - Portal:
 *     - It makes positioning harder because we need to explicitly pass the
 *       scrollable container to ensure popover position is maintained
 *       correctly as the container scrolls
 *     - We have a jump on window scroll for some reason
 *   - Non-portal
 *     - We should watch out for issues like nested forms
 *     - It doesn't work when there is a relative ancestor (which is the case
 *       within the drawer)
