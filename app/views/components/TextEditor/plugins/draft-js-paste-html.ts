/**
 * Draft.js has it's own convertFromHTMLtoContentBlocks which is not
 * configurable and extensible for handling image and stuff like that.
 * So images are not converted back from HTML. This plugin will use
 * {@link stateFromHTML} to convert pasted html to content blocks.
 * It also accepts options to be passed to {@link stateFromHTML}.
 *
 * Some important notes:
 * - DarftJS has some sort of logic to determine if it should
 *   use its internal clipboard for pasting from the editor to itself, without
 *   converting to and from html. Unfortunately, there is no way to provide
 *   custom paste handler and also benefit from this internal clipboard
 *   detection at the same time. So we need to kind of duplicate some logic
 *   there to ensure we don't mess up with this editor-to-editor copy pasting.
 *   We need to determine if this is an editor-to-editor paste. There are some
 *   weird if statements for Safari which we cannot add.
 *
 * - Content insertion code here and in the original paste handler is a bit
 *   different which may or may not cause some problems.
 *
 * - Draftjs's own convertFromHTMLtoContentBlocks does a better job in
 *   conversion from html. some inline styles for example seem to be lost with
 *   this plugin but are  handled properly in the built-in conversion from html.
