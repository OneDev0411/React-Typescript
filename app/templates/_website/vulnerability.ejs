    <h3>Policy</h3>

    <p>No technology is perfect, and Rechat Inc. believes that working with skilled security researchers across the
      globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. If you believe you've found a security issue in our
      product or service, we encourage you to notify us. We welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly.</p>

    <h4>Disclosure Policy</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential
        security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the
        issue.</li>
      <li>Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before
        any disclosure to the public or a third-party.</li>
      <li>Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of
        our service. * Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Exclusions</h4>
    <p>While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Denial of service</li>
      <li>Spamming</li>
      <li>Social engineering (including phishing) of Rechat staff or
        contractors</li>
      <li>Any physical attempts against Rechat property or data centers</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Safe Harbor</h4>
    <p>Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will
      be considered authorized conduct and we will not initiate legal action
      against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in
      connection with activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps
      to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this
      policy.</p>

    <h3>How to disclose vulnerabilities</h3>

    <p>You can send the vulnerability that you want to disclose to <a class="button-text-link"
        href="mailto:support@rechat.com" alt="email">vulnerabilities@rechat.com</a>.Provide as much information
      as possible about the potential issue you
      have discovered. The more information you provide, the quicker Rechat will be able to validate the issue.</p>
    <p>Specifically, we ask that you answer the following questions in your
      email:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What type of vulnerability is it?</li>
      <li>What are the steps to reproduce the vulnerability?</li>
      <li>Who would be able to use the vulnerability and what would they gain from it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to include attachments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Screenshots</li>
      <li>Logs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thank you for helping keep Rechat and our users safe!</p>
