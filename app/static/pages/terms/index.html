      <p>Rechat Terms of Service Last Updated: March 17, 2016</p>
      <p>Welcome to Rechat! Rechat Inc. (“Rechat”) provides an all-in-one real estate platform to professionals, including,
        without limitation, real estate agents, brokers and third-party providers of financial, legal, inspection and insurance
        professional services related to real estate transactions (collectively, “Real Estate Pros”) and their clients (“Clients”),
        through our mobile device application (the “App”) and our website located at rechat.com (the “Site”)]. Please read
        these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and our Privacy Policy (www.rechat.com/privacy) carefully because they govern
        your use of our App [and the Site]. To make these Terms easier to read, the App [, the Site] and our services are
        collectively called the “Services.”</p>
      <p>Agreement to Terms</p>
      <p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to these
        Terms and our Privacy Policy, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a
        company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind
        that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other
        legal entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless specified otherwise in these Terms, any references to “you” and
        “your” will refer to you, either in your capacity as a Real Estate Pro or Client using the Services.</p>
      <p>Changes to Terms or Services</p>
      <p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the
        modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we
        modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are
        indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified
        Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue
        all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
      <p>Who May Use the Services</p>
      <p>Eligibility</p>
      <p>You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with Rechat and
        are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.</p>
      <p>Registration and Your Information</p>
      <p>If you want to use the Services you will have to create and use an account (“Account”). Whether you are a Real Estate
        Pro or a Client, you will be able to send invitations to other Real Estate Pros or Clients, as applicable, to use
        the Services. A Real Estate Pro or Client Account may be referred to individually or collectively in these Terms
        as an “Account.” You can also create an Account through your account with certain third-party social networking services
        such as Facebook or Twitter (each, an “SNS Account”). If you choose the SNS Account option we’ll create your Account
        by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information such as your name and email address and other personal
        information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.</p>
      <p>It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree
        to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might have
        to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and you’ll
        notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under
        your Account, whether or not you know about them.</p>
      <p>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Using the Services</p>
      <p>Via the Services, Account holders can communicate with other Account holders to: (i) communicate and exchange real
        estate data from Multiple Listing Service (“MLS”) and other sources; (ii) invite other Real Estate Pros or Clients,
        as applicable, to join the Services and share and upload User Content (defined below), including videos and/or pictures
        of available listings; (iv) post and comment on User Content; (v) exchange MLS or other real estate listing data
        with their Real Estate Pros or Clients, as applicable; and (vi) Real Estate Pros can also create a profile to communicate
        with current and prospective Clients.</p>
      <p>Feedback</p>
      <p>We welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“Feedback”). You can submit Feedback
        by emailing us at feedback@rechat.com. You grant to us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid,
        royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license under any and all intellectual property rights that you own
        or control to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose.</p>
      <p>Privacy Policy</p>
      <p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy (www.rechat.com/privacy) for information on how we collect, use and disclose information
        from our users.</p>
      <p>Content and Content Rights</p>
      <p>For purposes of these Terms: (i) “Content” means MLS data, text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, works
        of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made
        available through the Services; and (ii) “User Content” means any Content that Account holders (including you) provide
        to be made available through the Services. Content includes without limitation User Content.</p>
      <p>Content Ownership, Responsibility and Removal</p>
      <p>Rechat does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict
        any rights that you may have to use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the foregoing, Rechat and its licensors
        exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services and Content, including all associated intellectual
        property rights. You acknowledge that the Services and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws
        of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service
        mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services or Content.</p>
      <p>Rights in User Content Granted by You</p>
      <p>By making any User Content available through Services you hereby grant to Rechat a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable,
        worldwide and royalty-free license to use, copy, modify (for formatting purposes only), distribute, publicly display
        and publicly perform your User Content in connection with operating and providing the Services and Content to you
        and to other Account holders.</p>
      <p>You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content
        or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms.
        You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to
        be made available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by us on or through the Services will infringe,
        misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result
        in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
      <p>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of your User Content
        (such as posts or comments you make) may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to
        exist on the Services. We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove
        or delete) any of your User Content.</p>
      <p>Rights in Content Granted by Rechat</p>
      <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Rechat grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
        license to access and view the Content solely in connection with your permitted use of the Services.</p>
      <p>Rights and Terms for App</p>
      <p>Rights in App Granted by Rechat</p>
      <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Rechat grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable
        license to download and install a copy of the App on a mobile device, tablet or computer that you own or control
        and, if you are a Client, such license will be solely for your use of the Services. You may not copy the App, except
        for making a reasonable number of copies for backup or archival purposes. Except as expressly permitted in these
        Terms, you may not: (i) copy, modify or create derivative works based on the App; (ii) distribute, transfer, sublicense,
        lease, lend or rent the App to any third party; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the App; or (iv)
        make the functionality of the App available to multiple users through any means. Rechat reserves all rights in and
        to the App not expressly granted to you under these Terms.</p>
      <p>Additional Terms for App Store Apps</p>
      <p>If you accessed or downloaded the App from the Apple Store, then you agree to use the App only: (i) on an Apple-branded
        product or device that runs iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system software); and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage
        Rules” set forth in the Apple Store Terms of Service.</p>
      <p>If you accessed or downloaded the App from any app store or distribution platform (like the Apple Store, Google Play
        or the Amazon Appstore) (each, an “App Provider”), then you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>• These Terms are concluded between you and Rechat, and not with App Provider, and that, as between Rechat and the
        App Provider, Rechat, is solely responsible for the App.</p>
      <p>• App Provider has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.</p>
      <p>• In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify App Provider and App
        Provider will refund the purchase price for the App to you (if applicable) and, to the maximum extent permitted by
        applicable law, App Provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App. Any other
        claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of an App to conform to any warranty
        will be the sole responsibility of Rechat.</p>
      <p>• App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the
        App or your possession and use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any
        claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under
        consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>
      <p>• In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party’s
        intellectual property rights, Rechat will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge
        of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms.</p>
      <p>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>• App Provider and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your license of the
        App, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, App Provider will have the right
        (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your license of the App against
        you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</p>
      <p>• You must also comply with all applicable third-party terms of service when using the App.</p>
      <p>• You agree to comply with all U.S. and foreign export laws and regulations to ensure that neither the App nor any

        designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government
        list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

        Warranty Disclaimers, Limitations of Liability, and Dispute Resolution Sections.</p>
      <p>Warranty Disclaimers</p>
      <p>THE SERVICES AND CONTENT, INCLUDING MLS DATA, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING
        THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET
        ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no
        warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free

        of any Content.</p>
      <p>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Indemnity</p>
      <p>You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Rechat and its officers, directors, employee and agents, from and against
        any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
        reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the
        Services or Content, (ii) your User Content, or (iii) your violation of these Terms.</p>
      <p>Limitation of Liability</p>
      <p>NEITHER RECHAT NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES OR CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE
        FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL,
        SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
        WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT,
        TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT RECHAT HAS BEEN INFORMED
        OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL
        PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
        DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
      <p>IN NO EVENT WILL RECHAT’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY
        TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO RECHAT FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR CONTENT OR ONE
        HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO RECHAT, AS APPLICABLE.</p>
      <p>THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN
        RECHAT AND YOU.</p>
      <p>Dispute Resolution</p>
      <p>Governing Law</p>
      <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to
        its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
      <p>Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
      <p>You and Rechat agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach,
        termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively,
        “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual
        action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction
        to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks,
        trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii),
        an “IP Protection Action”); and (iii) you retain the right to litigate any Dispute other than an IP Protection Action
        by providing Rechat with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at legal@rechat.com or Rechat
        Inc., 3700 Mckinney Ave. Unit 708, Dallas, TX 7520, within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these
        Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you do not provide Rechat with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice
        within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate
        any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
        any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Rechat with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and
        federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection
        to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Rechat with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you
        acknowledge and agree that you and Rechat are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff
        or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</p>
      <p>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Further, unless both you and Rechat otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's
        claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph
        is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided
        in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
      <p>Arbitration Rules</p>
      <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial
        Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect,
        except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by
        calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of
        this Section.</p>
      <p>Arbitration Process</p>
      <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified
        in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820
        and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator
        will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the
        AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery
        of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
      <p>Arbitration Location and Procedure</p>
      <p>Unless you and Rechat otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim
        does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and
        Rechat submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
        If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules,
        the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent
        with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
      <p>Arbitrator’s Decision</p>
      <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will
        include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration
        award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent
        with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a
        party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant
        and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in
        arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable
        law. Rechat will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees
        and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
      <p>Fees</p>
      <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA
        Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Rechat will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator
        finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or
        was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

        these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
      <p>General Terms</p>

        of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>

        provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
        representative of Rechat. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its
        remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
