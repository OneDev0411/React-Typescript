      <p>Rechat Privacy Policy</p>
      <p>Last Updated: March 17, 2016</p>
      <p>Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain
        our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. This
        Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible
        through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms
        used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have
        read and understand our Terms of Service.</p>
      <p>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</p>
      <p>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information
        is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy
        Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification,
        and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</p>
      <p>Collection and Use of Information Information Collected or Received from You</p>
      <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the
        Services (including your Account), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>
      <p>Account Information. If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you,
        such as your name and email address (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”). If you create an Account using
        your login credential from one of your SNS Accounts, we will be able to access and collect your name and email address
        and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through
        one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other information that is not considered
        PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</p>
      <p>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies. Like many website owners and operators, we use automated
        data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</p>
      <p>“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We
        may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell
        us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic
        routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are
        deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies,
        you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies.
        Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of
        the Services. Some third- party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place
        their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include
        use of Cookies by such third parties.</p>
      <p>“Web Beacons” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may
        be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and
        measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness
        of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded
        invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p>
      <p>Information Related to Use of the Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person
        uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”). Log Data may include information such as a user’s
        Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a user was visiting before accessing
        our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or
        features, search terms, the links on our Services that a user clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to
        administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and
        enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our users’ needs and preferences.
        We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p>
      <p>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device. We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our
        Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information
        about your use of our Services.</p>
      <p>Location Information. When you use our App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting
        your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location
        if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services
        for you, including providing you with relevant information about the properties you are in proximity with. If you
        do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</p>
      <p>Information that We Share with Third Parties</p>
      <p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</p>
      <p>Profile Information Shared by Real Estate Pros: If you are a Real Estate Pro, you will be able to create a Real Estate
        Pro profile and other Account holders, whether they are Real Estate Pros or Clients, could view your profile information.</p>
      <p>Information Shared with Other Users: When you use the Services to post or provide comments on User Content, such as
        uploading pictures or videos of property listings, the Real Estate Pros and Clients with whom you are connected within
        the Services will be able to view your comments and any related PII about you that you post.</p>
      <p>Information Shared by Invitation: If you invite other Real Estate Pros or Clients (as applicable) to join the Services,
        such prospective users will be able to see your name.</p>
      <p>Information Shared with MLS: In order to make Multiple Listing Services (“MLS”) data available to you, we may be required
        by such MLS data providers or by applicable state and federal laws governing real estate transactions to provide
        access to your PII so that they can identify who accesses the MLS data.</p>
      <p>Information Shared with Our Services Providers. We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer
        and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing
        services on our behalf.</p>
      <p>Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third
        parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p>
      <p>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from our users, including
        PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction
        such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out
        of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to
        a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>
      <p>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with government and law enforcement
        officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government
        or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate:
        (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and
        the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we
        consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
      <p>Your Choices</p>
      <p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we’ll respect the choices you make.
        Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all
        of the features of the Services.</p>
      <p>Opt-Out. We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote our Services. When you receive
        such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (either through your Account
        or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain
        communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications
        regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.</p>
      <p>Modifying Your Information. You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account through your Account settings.
        If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at support@rechat.com with your request. We’ll
        take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for
        our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>
      <p>Responding to Do Not Track Signals</p>
      <p>Our Site does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web browsers.</p>
      <p>The Security of Your Information</p>
      <p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect
        from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information
        on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting
        information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute
        security of any information.</p>
      <p>Links to Other Sites</p>
      <p>Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties, including MLS
        data providers (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or
        that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service
        and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security
        practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review
        the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.</p>
      <p>International Transfer</p>
      <p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other
        governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re
        located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States
        and process it there.</p>
      <p>Our Policy Toward Children</p>
      <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we
        learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files
        as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Your California Privacy Rights</p>
      <p>California residents may request and obtain from us, once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties, if any,
        to which we disclosed their PII for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year and the categories
        of PII shared with those third parties. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain that information, please
        submit your request by sending us an email at support@rechat.com with “California Privacy Rights” in the subject
        line or by writing to us at 3700 Mckinney Ave. Unit 708 Dallas TX 75204</p>
      <p>Questions?</p>
      <p>Please contact us at support@rechat.com, if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy.</p>
